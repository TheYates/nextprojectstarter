                <p>Clients are required to be honest and transparent in declaring the content of their packages before delivery at our warehouse.</p>

                <p>Machines, medical devices, fragile items, liquids, chemicals, gases, powders, cosmetics, battery goods (lithium batteries), corrosives, flammables, explosives, toxic substances, living organisms, radioactive materials, etc. are termed as:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                  <li>Sensitive Goods</li>

                  <li>Dangerous Goods</li>
                  <li>Special Goods</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Items listed above, as well as fragile goods, must be properly packaged and labelled according to acceptable UN standards for international shipping by AIR or SEA.</p>

                <p>ALS Global Shipping may decline to ship any of these hazardous materials or goods with inherent vice or goods that may pose risk to other packages if guidelines concerning packaging and labelling are not adhered to by the client.</p>

                <p>Each package must be accompanied by a warehouse declaration form fully filled by the supplier to confirm:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                  <li>All necessary information about the goods</li>
                  <li>Full name of client</li>
                </ul>
                <p>before the package(s) can be accepted at the warehouse for carriage by both AIR and SEA.</p>

                <p>This information may be vital for:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
                  <li>Invoice creation before goods are loaded</li>
                  <li>Insurance purposes</li>
                  <li>Customs declaration purposes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Thus, clients are encouraged to provide ALS Global Shipping the true value of their goods every time.</p>

                <p>ALS Global Shipping will not be liable nor accountable for any goods sent to our warehouse with false declaration which will result in confiscation by customs, either at port of loading (POL) or port of delivery (POD).</p>

                <p>Each package must have the appropriate shipping mark pasted on each package for easy identification and delivery. Kindly take note that ALS Global Shipping will not be held liable for consequences that may result from failure to comply.</p>

                <p>In case of any applied custom penalty or consequential losses or damages occurring due to failure to declare dangerous goods, the clients shall be held responsible and may have to pay for all damages, losses or penalties incurred.</p>

                <p>Clients must be aware that goods considered as dangerous may be shipped if declared and documented appropriately.</p>

                <p>ALS Global Shipping shall not be held liable for any penalty or seizure of goods if the client fails to declare as requested above.</p>
